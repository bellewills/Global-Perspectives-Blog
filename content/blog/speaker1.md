#### Brief Summary of the Talk 
In this talk, Charter delved into the intersection of computer science and space technology. They began by engaging the audience with questions about their understanding and views on space, before moving on to explain how space technology plays a vital role in our daily lives—impacting aspects such as weather predictions, GPS navigation, and global internet connectivity. The talk also explored the challenges of scaling space-related software systems and shared case studies of Charter's efforts to streamline space mission management through innovative tools and systems.

#### 1) What was the most surprising or thought-provoking idea from the talk?
The most surprising idea was how much our daily lives depend on space technology, from weather forecasts to GPS and internet services. It was also thought-provoking to learn about the scalability challenges in space software systems, particularly how Charter developed tools to manage complex space missions more efficiently. While space technology isn’t directly related to my career goals in web development, AI, and ethical hacking, it made me realise how interconnected technology is across fields. The challenges of scalability and efficiency in space systems are similar to those in web development, where managing large-scale data and ensuring real-time performance is critical. This connection broadened my perspective on the importance of robust software systems in any domain.

#### 2) What questions or curiosities did this lecture spark for you? If you asked the speaker a question, what was their response?
The lecture sparked curiosity about how space debris is managed and what measures are being taken to prevent incidents like space junk crashing into populated areas. This is important to me because it highlights the ethical and environmental responsibilities of technological advancements. While I’m excited about the potential of space technology, I also feel a sense of concern about the long-term consequences of space exploration, such as debris accumulation. If I had the opportunity to ask a question, I would have asked: “What are the current strategies for mitigating space debris, and how can software systems contribute to solving this problem?” In future, I plan to explore this further by reading literature such as Liou and Johnson (2009), who discuss NASA’s Orbital Debris Program Office strategies.

#### 3) What made you optimistic about the future from this talk?
The talk made me optimistic about the future because it highlighted how innovative software solutions, like those developed by Charter, can streamline space missions and make space technology more accessible. This optimism stems from the potential for these advancements to benefit humanity in tangible ways, such as improving global communication, enhancing weather forecasting accuracy, and even enabling space tourism. For example, better satellite systems could lead to more reliable internet access in remote areas, bridging the digital divide. The focus on scalability and efficiency also suggests that these technologies could be adapted to solve challenges in other industries, such as healthcare or logistics.

#### 4) What key ideas did the speaker highlight, and why are they significant with respect to trends in computing?
The speaker talked about how scalable software systems are essential for space missions, especially when dealing with large amounts of data and complex processes. I found this particularly relevant, as space technology is becoming a bigger part of everyday life, and there’s a growing need for systems that can handle that demand. It made me think of past examples, like how NASA used distributed computing for telemetry data back in the 1960s, or how more recent systems like Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) are now used in space networks. These examples show that scalable software has always played a key role in supporting progress in computing. The talk also highlighted the trend of utilising real-time data and collaboration tools, which are becoming increasingly vital in industries such as finance and healthcare. These trends reflect the growing demand for systems that can handle large-scale, real-time data while maintaining reliability and security.

#### 5) What ethical challenges might arise from the ideas covered in this talk, and how might they impact technology use?
One ethical challenge is the potential for space debris to cause harm, as highlighted by incidents where debris fell into populated areas. This raises some questions about the accountability and responsibility in space operations. For example, who is liable if space debris damages property or harms people? Additionally, as space technology becomes more advanced, concerns about security risks and data privacy may start to arise, particularly with the increasing reliance on global internet services and GPS. Some argue that international treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty (1967), lack enforcement power, while others advocate for stronger collaborative frameworks. I believe that these challenges highlight the necessity for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to ensure that space technology is developed and utilised responsibly.

#### 6) Did you agree or disagree with the ideas the speaker covered? Why? Why not?
I agreed with the speaker's ideas, particularly the emphasis on the importance of scalable and efficient software systems for space missions. The challenges they described, such as managing complex data and ensuring real-time collaboration, are critical for the future of space exploration. However, I would have liked to hear more about how these tools could address the growing issue of space debris. As someone interested in ethical hacking and cybersecurity, I see parallels between securing space systems and securing web applications. Both rely on strong authentication protocols, encrypted communication, and fault-tolerant systems. This connection reinforces my professional identity as someone who values innovation while prioritising ethical considerations.

#### 7) What role do you think the technology or concepts from this talk could play in influencing society in future?
The technology and concepts discussed in this talk could play a significant role in shaping the future of society by making space exploration more efficient and accessible. This could lead to advancements in global communication, weather forecasting, and even space tourism. For example, improved satellite systems could provide internet access to underserved regions, while advancements in space tourism could open up new economic opportunities. On the flip side, the increase in satellite launches could intensify space debris, potentially leading to chain-reaction events like the Kessler Syndrome (Kessler & Cour-Palais, 1978). I believe that while these technologies hold great promise, they must be developed with careful consideration of their long-term consequences.


#### 8) What connections can you make between this lecture and others in the series? (Ignore for the first talk). 


#### 9) For the assignment, you will present the outline of a future opportunity based on the topics covered in these talks. What ideas from the talk today do you think you could discuss with your groups to use in the assessment? If not using ideas from this talk for the assignment, why not?
For the assignment, I plan to explore how scalable software systems—like those developed by Charter—can be adapted for use in other sectors that face comparable challenges, such as healthcare or logistics. The concept of real-time data management and collaboration tools could be instrumental in these fields. For example, in healthcare, scalable systems could improve patient data management and enable real-time monitoring of medical devices. If we don’t use ideas from this talk, it might be because the focus is too niche on space technology, which may not align with the broader scope of the assignment. In that case, we could explore other topics, such as AI advancements or sustainable design practices, which are more directly related to our group’s interests and expertise.
