#### Brief Summary of the Talk 
In this talk, Charter delved into the intersection of computer science and space technology. They began by engaging the audience with questions about their understanding and views on space, before moving on to explain how space technology plays a vital role in our daily lives—impacting aspects such as weather predictions, GPS navigation, and global internet connectivity. The talk also explored the challenges of scaling space-related software systems and shared case studies of Charter's efforts to streamline space mission management through innovative tools and systems.

#### 1) What was the most surprising or thought-provoking idea from the talk?
The most surprising idea was how much our daily lives depend on space technology, from weather forecasts to GPS and internet services. It was also thought-provoking to learn about the scalability challenges in space software systems, particularly how Charter developed tools to manage complex space missions more efficiently. While space technology isn’t directly related to my own career goals which is web development, AI, and ethical hacking, it made me realise how interconnected technology is across fields. The challenges of scalability and efficiency in space systems are similar to those in web development, where managing large-scale data and ensuring real-time performance is critical. This connection broadened my perspective on the importance of robust software systems in any domain.

#### 2) What questions or curiosities did this lecture spark for you? If you asked the speaker a question, what was their response?
The lecture sparked curiosity about how space debris is managed and what measures are being taken to prevent incidents like space junk crashing into populated areas. This is important to me because it highlights the ethical and environmental responsibilities of technological advancements. While I’m excited about the potential of space technology, I also feel a sense of concern about the long-term consequences of space exploration, for example debris accumulation. If I had the opportunity to ask a question, I would have asked: “What are the current strategies for mitigating space debris, and how can software systems contribute to solving this problem?” In future, I plan to explore this further by reading literature such as Liou and Johnson (2009), who discuss NASA’s Orbital Debris Program Office strategies.

#### 3) What made you optimistic about the future from this talk?
The talk made me optimistic about the future because it highlighted how innovative software solutions, like those developed by Charter, can streamline space missions and make space technology more accessible. I think the optimism around this kind of tech comes from how much it could actually help people in real life. Like, it could make global communication way easier, improve how accurate our weather forecasts are, and even make things like space tourism a reality. Plus, if satellite systems get better, we might finally get more reliable internet in remote places—which could really help close the digital gap. The focus on scalability and efficiency also suggests that these technologies could be adapted to solve challenges in other industries, such as healthcare or logistics.

#### 4) What key ideas did the speaker highlight, and why are they significant with respect to trends in computing?
The guest speaker talked about how scalable software systems are essential for space missions especially when dealing with large amounts of data and complex processes. I found this particularly relevant, as space technology is becoming a bigger part of everyday life, and there’s a growing need for systems that can handle that demand. It made me think of past examples, like how NASA used distributed computing for telemetry data back in the 1960s, or how more recent systems like Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) are now used in space networks. These examples show that scalable software has always played a key role in supporting progress in computing. The talk also highlighted how real time collaboration tools and data are becoming a large deal, partictally in areas like healthcare and finance. This makes sense aas there’s such a growing demand for systems that can handle huge streams of live data while still being reliable and secure.

#### 5) What ethical challenges might arise from the ideas covered in this talk, and how might they impact technology use?
One ethical challenge is the potential for space debris to cause harm, as highlighted by incidents where debris fell into populated areas. This raises some questions about the accountability and responsibility in space operations. Like, what happens if space debris crashes into someone’s house or causes injurie who’s actually responsible for that? As space tech keeps advancing, I think more people are going to start worrying about security risks and data privacy too, especially since we rely so much on global internet services and GPS. Some people say international treaties like the Outer Space Treaty from 1967 don’t really have any teeth, while others push for stronger global agreements. Personally, I think all of this shows why we seriously need solid regulations and international cooperation to make sure space tech is used in a safe and fair way.

#### 6) Did you agree or disagree with the ideas the speaker covered? Why? Why not?
I agreed with a lot of what the speaker said—especially the part about how important scalable and efficient software systems are for space missions. The issues they brought up, like handling loads of complex data and making real-time collaboration work smoothly, are definitely going to be key for the future of space exploration. That said, I would’ve liked to hear more about how these systems could help tackle the growing problem of space debris. Since I’m really into ethical hacking and cybersecurity, I couldn’t help but notice the similarities between securing space tech and securing web apps. Both need strong authentication, encrypted comms, and systems that don’t fall apart under pressure. That link really reinforces how I see myself—as someone who’s into pushing boundaries with tech but still puts ethics and security first.

#### 7) What role do you think the technology or concepts from this talk could play in influencing society in future?
The tech and ideas from this talk could definitely shape how society moves forward—especially by making space exploration more efficient and easier to access. That could mean better global communication, more accurate weather forecasts, and maybe even space tourism becoming a real thing. If satellite systems keep improving, we could finally get internet in places that have always been left out. And if space tourism takes off, that could bring in loads of new economic opportunities. But on the flip side, more satellite launches could make the space debris problem worse, which raises serious risks—like the Kessler Syndrome, where debris just keeps multiplying and crashing into other stuff (Kessler & Cour-Palais, 1978). I believe that while these technologies hold great promise, they must be developed with careful consideration of their long-term consequences.


#### 8) What connections can you make between this lecture and others in the series? (Ignore for the first talk). 


#### 9) For the assignment, you will present the outline of a future opportunity based on the topics covered in these talks. What ideas from the talk today do you think you could discuss with your groups to use in the assessment? If not using ideas from this talk for the assignment, why not?
For the assignment, I plan to explore how scalable software systems—like those developed by Charter—can be adapted for use in other sectors that face comparable challenges, such as healthcare or logistics. The idea of real time data and collaboration tools could be really useful in fields such as healthcare. For example, scalable systems could help manage patient records better or even allow real time monitoring of medical devices. That said, if we end up not using this talk in our final project, it might be because the focus on space tech feels a bit too niche and doesn’t quite fit the wider scope of our assignment. If that’s the case, we could look at other areas that line up more with our group’s interests, like AI developments or sustainable design, which feel a bit more relevant to what we’re aiming to do.
