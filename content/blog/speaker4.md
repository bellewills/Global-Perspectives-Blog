#### Brief Summary of the Talk

 The talk explored IBM's work in quantum computing, the fundamental concepts behind it, and its emerging real-world applications. It introduced the shift from classical bits to quantum bits (qubits), explained concepts like superposition and entanglement, and outlined the impact quantum computing could have on industries such as banking, aerospace, and logistics. The speaker also discussed IBM's approach to post-quantum cryptography, the challenges of scaling quantum systems, and how these developments tie into future trends in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. 


#### 1) What was the most surprising or thought-provoking idea from the talk?
The most surprising idea was the explanation of quantum entanglement—how two qubits can be entangled so that changing one instantly affects the other, even across vast distances. It felt like a collision between science fiction and science fact. I’ve come across the term before, but hearing it applied so directly to real quantum systems made it suddenly feel tangible—and that left me both fascinated and uneasy.

It raised a deeper question for me: How much of technology do I really understand, and how much do I simply accept as “magic” because it works? Quantum computing exposes the limits of what I thought I understood about cause and effect, and that made me feel small, like I was glimpsing a deeper layer of reality I wasn’t quite ready for.

The physical fragility of quantum systems added to this feeling. The speaker explained how qubits need to be suspended in air and cooled to near absolute zero to prevent even the faintest environmental noise from disrupting them. I found myself wrestling with that contrast: something so delicate holding so much potential power. It left me wondering whether this kind of technological fragility mirrors our social systems—seemingly robust on the surface but vulnerable underneath.

#### 2) What questions or curiosities did this lecture spark for you? If you asked the speaker a question, what was their response?
I asked the speaker about post-quantum cryptography (PQC) — specifically, how close we are to replacing current encryption standards with quantum-safe algorithms. The speaker explained that although PQC is still evolving, IBM is proactively working with partners to assess vulnerabilities and adjust their encryption protocols accordingly. However, they acknowledged that if a quantum computer were to fall into the wrong hands, the risks to sectors like banking and insurance could be extremely high — something that left a lasting impression on me. It sparked more curiosity about how much of today’s digital infrastructure is actually ready for a post-quantum world.

In future, I want to read further into the NIST-led Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project and IBM’s 2024 whitepaper on quantum-safe readiness to understand how industry and government are preparing for these risks.


#### 3) What made you optimisitc about the future from this talk?
I felt hopeful hearing about IBM’s active work toward making quantum computing accessible. The fact that they’ve developed learning platforms like Qiskit gave me a sense that this technology won’t be locked away in elite labs. It felt like an invitation for ordinary people to learn and participate, which mattered to me. I often feel uneasy about corporate monopolies over emerging tech, so this attempt at democratising access felt like a small but meaningful step in the right direction.

But even as I sat with that hope, I found myself questioning its depth. Will open-source learning really level the playing field? Or will the companies that own the hardware always hold the real power? I felt a familiar tension—hopeful about the potential, yet wary of the structures surrounding it.

That ambivalence stayed with me. I realised that trust in technology isn’t just about what the tech can do—it’s about who controls it and for what purpose. I was left wondering whether education alone is enough to counterbalance corporate dominance in this space.

#### 4) What key ideas did the speaker highlight and why are they significant with respect to trends in computing?
Key ideas included:

Quantum Utility vs Quantum Advantage: We’re now in the utility phase — where quantum computers can do useful things, even if they don't yet outperform classical computers.
Superposition and Entanglement: These aren’t just theory — they’re already being used in quantum circuits.
Quantum-centric supercomputing: A new computing model, combining classical and quantum processing.
These ideas are significant because they point to a paradigm shift in computing. We're no longer just focused on making classical computers faster — we’re building a new kind of computer that thinks and works differently. That’s a big trend in tech right now: moving beyond the limits of Moore’s Law.

This shift reflects a broader history of computing breakthroughs—from the transition to transistor-based machines in the 1950s to the emergence of parallel processing and cloud computing in the 2000s. Quantum computing now pushes us beyond Moore’s Law, echoing the same kind of paradigm shifts seen when digital computing first replaced analogue systems.

#### 5) What ethical challenges might arise from the ideas covered in this talk, and how might they impact technology use?
One deep ethical challenge is data security—particularly who controls quantum power. If quantum computers can break current encryption standards, then who owns them becomes a global concern. The thought of banking systems, healthcare records, and national security data becoming vulnerable sent a ripple of discomfort through me.

But what unsettled me most wasn’t just the technical risk—it was the social imbalance it could create. Will powerful nations or corporations hoard this technology while others fall behind? I couldn’t help but think about power dynamics, and how new technologies often reinforce existing hierarchies.

There’s also the question of misuse. The speaker mentioned the threat of quantum computers falling into the wrong hands—but I wondered, what defines the “wrong hands”? Even the “right” hands—governments and corporations—haven’t always used power responsibly. This left me feeling uneasy about how we define ethical ownership in technology. It’s not just about controlling the hardware—it’s about who decides what’s ethical in the first place.

Lastly, sustainability weighed on me. Quantum computers require significant cooling and energy use, yet this wasn’t discussed much. I felt frustrated that such an important aspect of long-term tech viability was brushed aside. It made me question: How do we balance innovation with environmental responsibility? It felt like a gap in the conversation that I couldn’t ignore.

Some technologists argue that quantum breakthroughs should be governed by global ethics councils to prevent exploitation. Others suggest that innovation will always outpace regulation, and that public pressure—not policy—will shape how tech giants use quantum tools. I’m torn between both—hopeful for oversight, but realistic about corporate momentum.


#### 6) Did you agree or disagree with the ideas the speaker covered? Why? Why not?
I agreed with the speaker’s central message—that quantum computing demands preparation now, especially around cybersecurity. However, I felt the talk focused too heavily on technical readiness and too little on the broader ethical landscape. The risks were acknowledged, but there wasn’t enough about who holds accountability for those risks.

This left me feeling uneasy. Can we trust the same corporations that profit from data today to safeguard it tomorrow with quantum power? I’m not convinced. I wanted the speaker to go deeper into the social implications of control—to question the structures around the technology, not just the technology itself.

I also disagreed with the lack of attention to environmental costs. Quantum systems require vast resources to maintain their delicate environments. Ignoring that felt like turning away from a critical part of the ethical equation.

So, while I admired the technical achievements presented, I left with unresolved questions about trust, access, and sustainability—all of which matter as much as technical progress.

#### 7) What role do you think the technology or concepts from this talk could play in influencing society in future?
Quantum computing feels like standing at the edge of something monumental—a technology that could reshape the very fabric of society. Its potential to transform cybersecurity, optimise global logistics, advance medical research, and tackle climate modelling makes it one of the most powerful tools humanity could wield. But that word—wield—keeps echoing in my mind. Who gets to wield this power?

It’s easy to get swept up in the excitement of quantum breakthroughs, imagining all the ways they might solve the world’s biggest problems. But this talk left me asking: Will those solutions be accessible to everyone, or will they remain the privilege of those already in control? The speaker touched on education platforms like Qiskit, and that did give me some hope—that perhaps we can democratise access and nurture a broader generation of quantum thinkers.

Still, a nagging uncertainty lingers. Education alone doesn’t guarantee equity if the infrastructure stays in the hands of the few. Quantum computing could narrow the world’s problems, or it could widen the divide—between those with access to quantum systems and those left behind in the classical world.

I felt a pull between hope and concern. I want to believe that quantum power can be used to improve lives, but I also fear that it could become another layer of inequality—a digital chasm where only wealthy nations or corporations benefit from the breakthroughs, while others remain disconnected from this quantum revolution.

In this sense, the influence of quantum computing on society hinges not just on what the technology can do, but on how we choose to share and govern it. That’s the part that leaves me both excited and uneasy—quantum potential is limitless, but social systems are anything but neutral.

#### 8) What connections can you make between this lecture and others in the series? (Ignore for the first talk). 
This IBM Quantum Computing talk connected meaningfully with the previous lectures in the series. In the aerospace session, we learned about complex optimisation challenges like flight routing and satellite coordination, which quantum computing could help solve more efficiently. The HCI talk explored how humans interact with technology, and this links to how we might make quantum tools like Qiskit more accessible through intuitive interfaces or AI assistance. The strongest connection was with the cybersecurity lecture, as quantum computing poses a major threat to current encryption methods, reinforcing the urgent need for post-quantum cryptography. Altogether, these talks show how emerging technologies are deeply interconnected—where quantum computing offers powerful solutions, HCI ensures usability, and cybersecurity ensures trust and protection in a rapidly evolving digital world.

#### 9) For the assignment, you will present the outline of a future opportunity based on the topics covered in these talks. What ideas from the talk today do you think you could discuss with your groups to use in the assessment? If not using ideas from this talk for the assignment, why not?

This talk left me thinking seriously about the urgency of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). With the threat to current encryption systems looming larger as quantum power grows, I feel that designing a quantum-safe communication system—perhaps for IoT devices—is not just a good idea for the assignment but something that needs to happen. I keep coming back to the idea of a future where everyday devices are left vulnerable unless quantum-resistant protections are in place.

But as I sit with this idea, I also feel the weight of its complexity. Can we really tackle something so vast within the scope of an assignment? There's a tension between wanting to contribute to solving this critical issue and acknowledging the scale of what’s required. That makes me lean toward framing our project around a specific use case, like smart homes or medical IoT devices, where quantum-safe communication protocols could have immediate, tangible impacts. Grounding it this way makes the threats feel real and personal, not abstract.

Alternatively, the speaker’s mention of logistics optimisation sparked another idea—developing a quantum-powered, climate-responsive delivery network. This would be a system that could adjust in real-time to changing weather patterns, perhaps even helping reduce carbon emissions by optimising transport routes dynamically. This concept felt hopeful—a way to use quantum computing for environmental good, which is important to me given my concerns about the sustainability of quantum systems themselves.

Yet, I’m also aware that quantum aesthetics—the abstract beauty of entanglement, superposition, and uncertainty—could inspire something conceptual or creative. Even if our project doesn't directly engage with quantum hardware, the logic and imagery of quantum systems could shape how we design or visualise digital interactions. That possibility feels like an invitation to explore the unknown—to experiment with how quantum thinking could inform new forms of design.

If we decide not to use ideas from this talk, it will likely be because the scope of quantum computing is too large or too abstract for our current project’s technical constraints. But even then, I think this talk will linger in the background, shaping how I think about security, scale, and the future of technology.
