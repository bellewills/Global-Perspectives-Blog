#### Brief Summary of the Talk 
Dr Daniel Gardham’s talk on cybersecurity and cryptography guided us through a layered narrative of encryption—from early historical methods to speculative futures shaped by quantum computing. He traced the evolution of encryption, starting with simple ciphers like Caesar’s, moving into mathematically grounded modern systems, and ending with the looming spectre of quantum threats. This wasn’t just a technical journey—it was a story about trust, power, and the fragility of digital security. His discussion of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and lattice-based cryptography painted a picture of future-proofing systems not just against today’s hackers but against threats that don’t even exist yet. It left me asking: Can we ever really be ready for what’s coming?

#### 1) What was the most surprising or thought-provoking idea from the talk?
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) felt like the most mind-bending concept—the idea that data could be processed without ever being decrypted. At first, it sounded like science fiction, but then I realised it already exists, at least in theory. That hit me harder than I expected. It challenged this quiet assumption I’ve always had: that security is a trade-off—you either protect data or process it, but not both. FHE dismantled that belief.

I felt this strange mix of awe and unease. Awe at what’s possible, but unease because trusting this process requires faith in math I can’t fully grasp. If even encrypted data can now be “read” without being decrypted, where does that leave the concept of privacy? It made me question: What is privacy, really, in a world where data is never truly inaccessible—even when it’s protected?

#### 2) What questions or curiosities did this lecture spark for you? If you asked the speaker a question, what was their response?
I left the talk grappling with timing—how close are we to needing these quantum-resistant systems? There was this underlying anxiety: Are we preparing fast enough? Or are we in denial about how vulnerable we really are? I wanted to ask Dr Gardham about the gap between the cutting-edge cryptography being developed and the ability of smaller organisations to implement it. Big corporations might be getting ready, but what about schools, hospitals, or local governments? Who’s looking out for them?

That disconnect between innovation and accessibility stirred something in me—a kind of protective instinct for the systems that don’t have the luxury of preparing for quantum threats. It left me wondering whether security innovation sometimes runs too far ahead of the real world.

In future, I plan to follow this further by looking into NIST’s post-quantum cryptography standardisation project (NIST, 2022) to better understand how implementation is progressing globally.

#### 3) What made you optimisitc about the future from this talk?
Despite the dark cloud of quantum threats, I felt a stubborn thread of optimism. Knowing that global bodies like NIST are working on standardising post-quantum cryptography (PQC) reassured me that we’re not ignoring the danger. There’s a collective effort happening quietly in the background, and that gave me hope.

But the real source of optimism came from FHE’s potential to protect privacy without sacrificing functionality. Imagine a future where sensitive healthcare data can be analysed for patterns without ever exposing a single patient’s details. That feels revolutionary. It whispers a possibility that security and innovation don’t have to be enemies. They could coexist.

And yet, even in that hope, I found myself questioning: Are we putting too much faith in technology to solve ethical problems? Is perfect encryption enough, or do we also need to rethink the power structures around data access? I felt the tension between technical solutions and human systems.

#### 4) What key ideas did the speaker highlight, and why are they significant with respect to trends in computing?
Dr Gardham painted cryptography’s evolution as a reflection of broader shifts in computing. We’ve moved from outsmarting attackers with clever tricks to proving mathematically that systems are secure. This mirrors how security has become foundational—no longer just a bolt-on at the end of the software process, but a core design principle.

I found this significant because it echoed a larger trend: trust in systems is no longer assumed. As AI, IoT, and cloud computing expand, security becomes the ground floor, not the roof. PQC and FHE are the next layers of that foundation—technologies designed to outlast the threats we can’t yet see.

But I also felt the weight of that ambition. Can we ever truly secure everything? Or is security always a race we can never win, only keep running?

This mirrors the evolution of security from early manual ciphers like the Enigma machine in WWII to public key infrastructure in the 1970s—each step a response to escalating complexity and threat. Gardham’s emphasis on proactive, provable security builds on that long historical trajectory.

#### 5) What ethical challenges might arise from the ideas covered in this talk, and how might they impact technology use?
The secrecy vs privacy debate cut deep. FHE could empower privacy, allowing data to be used without being exposed—but it also made me ask: Who controls the encryption keys? Cloud providers might promise end-to-end encryption, but what happens if governments demand access? Or if corporations abuse that control?

It reminded me that technology alone doesn’t solve ethical problems—it often amplifies them. Strong encryption could just as easily shield wrongdoing as protect innocence. That left me restless—knowing there was no easy answer. Striking the balance between security, privacy, and accountability felt like trying to walk a tightrope in the dark.

Some technologists argue that encryption should be absolute to protect civil liberties. Others argue that lawful access is essential for justice and public safety. I find myself caught between these perspectives—wanting to protect privacy, but aware of how encryption can be abused.

#### 6) Did you agree or disagree with the ideas the speaker covered? Why? Why not?
I agreed with Dr Gardham’s insistence that mathematical guarantees are essential in today’s cybersecurity. But I felt a gnawing scepticism about FHE’s real-world viability right now. The computational overhead feels like a barrier that can’t be ignored, especially for sectors like healthcare where speed matters as much as privacy.

This left me torn. FHE represents hope—but also frustration at how theoretical solutions often outpace what’s practical. Are we solving the right problems, or just proving we can?

I wanted more discussion on real-world adoption—not just what’s possible, but what’s feasible today.

#### 7) What role do you think the technology or concepts from this talk could play in influencing society in future?
FHE and PQ cryptography could reshape digital trust. They hold the potential to redefine privacy, making it possible to process data securely, even in the cloud. That idea felt empowering—like putting control back in the hands of individuals, not just institutions.

But again, the human element lingered. Even with perfect encryption, who decides when it’s used? These technologies could create a safer digital world, or they could deepen the divide between those who can afford them and those who can’t.

I left wondering: Is technology enough, or do we need new social contracts too?

#### 8) What connections can you make between this lecture and others in the series? 
Dr Gardham’s talk on cryptography and quantum threats connected in unexpected ways to both Mirim Sturdee’s and Charter’s presentations, though they approached security and scalability from different angles.

With Sturdee, while she touched on cybersecurity, it was from a design communication perspective, using sketching and comics to visualise potential risks. I felt she was more focused on drawing out scenarios rather than following through with tangible solutions—posing questions like "What could go wrong?" without always addressing how to solve those issues. In contrast, Gardham’s approach was grounded in coding, logic, and mathematical foundations—providing real, technical pathways to secure systems. His talk was more aligned with my interest in how encryption works at a fundamental level and how to future-proof it against quantum threats.

Charter’s talk revolved around scalability in the space industry, especially around software systems that support space missions. While their focus wasn’t cybersecurity per se, there were some fascinating overlaps. For instance, their struggles with access control (ABAC) and data reconciliation across systems reflect similar challenges to secure system design that Gardham discussed—ensuring data integrity and authentication. Both Charter and Gardham recognised that the bigger the system, the more complex securing it becomes, whether it's spacecraft systems or cryptographic frameworks.

All three talks underscored the importance of building resilient, scalable systems—whether in design, security, or space engineering. However, Gardham’s lecture felt the most practically aligned with my passion for encryption and quantum-safe security solutions.

#### 9) For the assignment, you will present the outline of a future opportunity based on the topics covered in these talks. What ideas from the talk today do you think you could discuss with your groups to use in the assessment? If not using ideas from this talk for the assignment, why not?

For the assignment, Dr Gardham’s exploration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents a rich opportunity. I’m especially interested in quantum-resistant encryption for IoT systems—securing critical infrastructure like healthcare devices, autonomous vehicles, or space communication networks before quantum computing makes current methods obsolete.

Although Charter’s talk centred on scaling software in the space sector, I could see linking quantum-safe cryptography into that context—protecting the data flows between satellites, ground stations, and mission control, ensuring secure communication even in a quantum future. Their struggles with access control and system scalability also make me think about how encryption protocols must be designed to scale with growing infrastructure.

While Sturdee’s focus on the creative visualisation of cybersecurity concepts has value for communicating ideas or educating users, it feels less applicable to the technical depth I want for this project. My focus is on building secure systems, not just visualising risks.

So overall, I’d lean heavily into Gardham’s themes—combining quantum-resistant encryption with scalability lessons from Charter to shape a project that’s both technically robust and future-ready.
