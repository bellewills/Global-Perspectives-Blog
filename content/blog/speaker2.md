#### Brief Summary of the Talk 
Mirim Sturdee’s talk was a total creative whirlwind—she brought together design innovation, HCI, and sustainability through sketching in such a playful way. Strudee talked about design fiction, using storytelling and prototyping to imagine future risks, and shared wild scenarios like a robot pet getting hacked. There were shape-shifting interfaces, cybersecurity tied to human features, and even interactive games made with PowerPoint. It was all really imaginative and fun, but I couldn’t help wondering how much of it actually moves beyond the sketchpad. The talk definitely fired up my imagination, but I also came away feeling a bit restless like I wanted to see more real-world follow-through.

#### 1) What was the most surprising or thought-provoking idea from the talk?
The most surprising idea was the reminder that AI isn’t truly intelligent—it lacks consciousness or general understanding. I’ve heard this before, but the way Sturdee framed it, embedded in creative design and speculative fiction, brought it into sharper focus. It left me feeling both deflated and driven. On one hand, it disappointed me—AI isn’t as advanced as I sometimes hope it is. But on the other, it ignited something deeper. If AI is still limited, then there’s room to push those boundaries, and that excites me.

But what lingered even more was the playfulness of her approach—taking something as serious as cybersecurity and imagining it through sketches and storyboards. That approach surprised me. It made me wonder: Am I too focused on outcomes? On building? Her abstract thinking challenged me to step back and imagine. But it also left me hungry for action.

#### 2) What questions or curiosities did this lecture spark for you? If you asked the speaker a question, what was their response?
I found myself curious about the “What next?”. Sturdee shared so many fascinating sketches and storyboards, but I kept wondering: Do any of these ever get built? Do they move beyond fiction? I wanted to ask her: Have you ever taken one of these speculative designs and turned it into a working prototype?

This question kept coming back because of where I am in my own journey—moving from art and design into computer science. I understand the power of creative exploration, but I also know how much more powerful it can be when it’s built.

I did appreciate when someone asked about shape-changing nanobots in healthcare, and she acknowledged the possibility, though it felt distant—"one day". That ambiguous distance frustrated me. How do we bridge that gap between ideas and implementation? It left me thinking about funding, too—how do independent creatives get the support to develop these ideas further?

In future, I plan to explore this further by looking at work like Blythe et al. (2016), who examine how speculative design can transition into working prototypes through user engagement.

#### 3) What made you optimisitc about the future from this talk?
The creativity behind some of the ideas gave me these little bursts of optimism. Stuff like nanobots cleaning up the oceans or being used for targeted drug delivery actually felt kind of hopeful. They were small glimpses of big change and it reminded me that imagination is often what pushes progress forward in the first place.

But my optimism felt tempered. Hope is one thing, implementation is another. I realised that, for me, hope grows stronger when imagination meets development. While Sturdee opened doors to exciting futures, I was left longing for a roadmap a sense of how to get there.

Still, there was something refreshing about the freedom to imagine without constraints. It made me reflect on how often I get caught up in feasibility and how sometimes design needs space to breathe before it’s built.

#### 4) What key ideas did the speaker highlight, and why are they significant with respect to trends in computing?
The central themes were design fiction, shape-changing interfaces, AI’s current limitations, and sustainability in design. These are critical trends in HCI and computing, especially as technology becomes more embedded in our lives.

Her emphasis on designing for what could go wrong felt important—it’s a reminder that tech innovation isn’t just about building the next thing but anticipating its risks. That aligns with broader trends like ethical AI, eco-conscious tech, and user-centered interfaces.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that, as essential as these ideas are, they’re still kind of stuck in the concept stage. Where’s the next step? When does the storyboard actually turn into a working system? That gap between idea and implementation felt like the missing link for me.

To ground this in history, these themes connect to early HCI milestones like the 1982 GaTech Design Conference or ACM SIGCHI's founding in 1983—moments where human experience began shaping computing. Design fiction today builds on that legacy.

#### 5) What ethical challenges might arise from the ideas covered in this talk, and how might they impact technology use?
The robot pet hack scenario she shared highlighted security risks in everyday devices, and that stuck with me. It made me reconsider how integrated technology has become—if even our pets could be hacked, what does that say about our homes, our health, our data?

Shape-changing technologies and nanobots also raised privacy and surveillance concerns. If tech can adapt and move unnoticed, who controls it? The ethical challenge isn’t just about what these technologies can do but about who governs them and how transparent they are.

But the biggest challenge I felt was what happens when we stop at design fiction. If we never build these systems, do we avoid the ethical consequences—or do we risk someone else building them without that foresight? This limbo between fiction and reality felt like an ethical grey area.

Some argue that speculative designs allow the safe exploration of dangerous ideas. Others say this distance enables developers to ignore hard questions. I think it depends on how self aware the design process is.

#### 6) Did you agree or disagree with the ideas the speaker covered? Why? Why not?
I agreed with her belief that imagination matters—that storyboarding risks help future-proof design. But I found myself disagreeing with how far she let that process go. For me, creativity is a starting point, not the end. I felt frustrated that nothing seemed to move beyond sketches and stories.

Maybe that’s because of where I am personally. Having come from an art and design background, I’m now studying computer science because I want to build. I don’t want to stay in the design phase. I want to see ideas become real.

This transition from creative speculation to grounded development is part of why I shifted from art school to a computer science degree. I wanted more control, more implementation, more rigour. But I don’t want to lose the imagination that brought me here.

Perhaps that is why Charter’s talk, which focused on scaling real systems in the space industry, felt so different. They dealt with messy realities, while Sturdee stayed in the abstract. It made me appreciate the balance—we need both dreamers and builders—but I know which side I’m on.

#### 7) What role do you think the technology or concepts from this talk could play in influencing society in future?
Design fiction could be a powerful tool for anticipating risks—it gives us space to imagine problems before they happen. Shape-changing interfaces and nanobots could reshape healthcare, environmental sustainability, and user experience. But only if they’re built.

That’s the tension I felt—these ideas could influence society profoundly, but only if someone takes the leap from sketch to system. How many good ideas never make it that far? It left me wondering how much creativity gets lost in the gap between imagination and implementation.

#### 8) What connections can you make between this lecture and others in the series? (Ignore for the first talk). 
Having only attended Charter’s space systems talk before this, the contrast was striking. Charter’s team focused on scaling real-world systems, grappling with access control and software complexity. Sturdee, on the other hand, was floating in the realm of possibility.

Both talks dealt with complex systems—but where Charter navigated reality, Sturdee navigated imagination. I felt drawn to both but also frustrated by the gap. What would happen if these two worlds collided—if dreamers worked side by side with engineers?

#### 9) For the assignment, you will present the outline of a future opportunity based on the topics covered in these talks. What ideas from the talk today do you think you could discuss with your groups to use in the assessment? If not using ideas from this talk for the assignment, why not?

While shape-changing tech and nanobots offered intriguing possibilities, they felt too speculative for the kind of project I wanted to pursue right now. If I want to delve deeper into data privacy, cybersecurity, and real-world threats within global computing, I need something grounded in current technologies and systems.

That’s why, for the assignment, I’m leaning more toward topics like post-quantum cryptography or securing IoT systems—areas where immediate risks exist and tangible solutions are needed. Design fiction might still have a role as a planning tool, helping to visualise potential risks or ethical dilemmas around cybersecurity frameworks. But the core focus for me is on addressing real-world vulnerabilities, not just hypothetical scenarios.

In this sense, Sturdee’s talk might inform how I approach the design phase, but the heart of my project lies in building systems that withstand real threats.
