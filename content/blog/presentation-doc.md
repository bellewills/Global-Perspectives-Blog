## Group Reflection 

At the start of this project, our original plan was to create a news-style broadcast, something that felt immediate, polished, and official, like a live government announcement. We envisioned it jumping through key moments in time, immersing the viewer in the unfolding SmartVote narrative as if they were watching real-time coverage year by year. However, as development progressed, we ran into major complications with the external company hosting the platform we were using.

We faced a serious obstacle: the company ultimately refused to let us retain or publicly share the final video. Synthesia, the company / website we used were concerned that the use of AI-generated visuals, combined with the film’s themes of political manipulation, might be seen as spreading misinformation or fake news, something that went against their company’s values. Although we understood their reasoning, it was still disappointing.
Ironically, it mirrored the very ideas our project was exploring: censorship, media control, and the way truth is shaped by those in power. Their rejection only reinforced our central critique.

As a result, we restructured the piece into a short, documentary-style film, more like a Black Mirror retrospective. This format allowed us to frame the story as a look back from the future, reflecting on how society came to rely on neural chips, predictive systems, and AI-driven governance. It gave us the flexibility to incorporate richer worldbuilding, like the emergence of FreedomOS, the F.O.M. protests, and the GlitchFace breach, as part of a broader political timeline.

We also made a conscious decision to use AI generated visuals throughout the film. This choice was inspired by Terence Broad’s talk on AI-generated art, which Keya had selected as part of our research. Broad’s work showed us that machine-generated imagery can effectively support themes of artificiality, ambiguity, and manipulation, which were central to the world we were building. The visuals added an uncanny tone to the piece, making viewers feel unsettled, just enough to question what was real and what had been constructed. This directly supported our critique of algorithmic trust in political systems.

Each of the speakers we engaged with shaped our concept in specific ways. Daniel Gardham’s lecture on post-quantum cryptography provided the foundation for FreedomOS, our imagined resistance platform. His warning that current encryption methods won’t survive the quantum leap helped us design SmartVote as a seemingly convenient system that ultimately undermines autonomy.

Jake Davis shifted our entire lens. His personal account of hacktivism helped us reframe hackers not as criminals, but as necessary disruptors—people who step in when systems fail. This inspired the GlitchFace scandal, the rise of F.O.M., and the broader theme of digital resistance. His talk challenged us to think about justice, control, and how power is held to account when traditional structures break down.
Mirim Sturdee’s talk on speculative design encouraged us to embrace satire and exaggeration. Her invitation to “design what could go wrong” led directly to moments like the auto-filled vote and the HowHumanAreYou interface—absurd but grounded in plausible trajectories. Her perspective helped us move beyond realism and into cautionary storytelling.

HackMasters and our follow-up discussion with Saher Sidhom provided the emotional and ethical heart of our project. The idea that people willingly implanted neural chips, believing they were gaining control, only to realise they were being predicted and nudged, became central to our narrative. The parallel between their fictional Mindopoly system and our SmartVote framework was intentional—both begin with convenience and end with disillusionment.

Together, these talks helped us build a world we called Post-Quantum Futures, a future shaped by predictive algorithms, where autonomy becomes performative and free will is a fading memory. Switching from a broadcast format to a documentary gave us the narrative distance to reflect critically on this world, as if it had already happened, asking the audience: how did we let it get this far?

What worked especially well was the structure and emotional pacing of the film. The gradual shift from sleek optimism to quiet unease mirrored the themes we wanted to explore. The AI-generated imagery added a distinct, almost clinical aesthetic that reinforced the artificial trust we were critiquing.

If we were to improve one element, it would be the backend logic. While the user interface and flow were clear, we could have gone further in showing how the system functioned, how data was collected, how predictions were made, and how resistance platforms like FreedomOS technically operated. We also wanted to show alternative outcomes, such as what happens when a user refuses to sync their chip or tries to opt out entirely.

In the end, our whole project was shaped not only by the talks we attended but also by our shared curiosity about autonomy, control, and the future of ethics in technology. The world we created is speculative, yet it is rooted in genuine concerns, existing technologies, and trends that are already starting to take shape around us.
